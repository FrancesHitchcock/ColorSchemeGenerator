# Colour Scheme Generator Solo Project - Scrimba Module 9: Working with APIs 

## About The Project

This Project was built from scratch, alone and unaided following the URLs, REST & BlogSpace Section of the Working with APIs Module. The goals were to follow a Figma design spec and to use The Color API schemes section at https://www.thecolorapi.com/docs#schemes to produce a web page that displays five colours in response to a request to the API. 

The requirements of the project were as follows:

- Choose a "seed colour" from an \<input type="color" /\>
- Choose colour scheme mode in a \<select\> box
- Clicking a button makes a request to the API to get the colour scheme
- Display the scheme colours and hex values on the page

All requirements were met, as well as the following stretch goal:

- Click hex values to copy to clipboard.

I also added additional functionality to improve the user experience:

- Media queries were used to display colours vertically on screens of width less than 400px (using "mobile-first" approach)
- A "brightness value" calculation was included so on smaller screens the hex code could be displayed in front of its colour in either dark or light text to provide sufficient contrast with its background. The calculation was adapted from an example provided at https://hackmd.io/@Markdown-It/HJeV6339X
